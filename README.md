## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to position one image over the other, using the properties, left, top, right, bottom and with this property I was able to position the two images and apply a hover effect with a smooth transition.
